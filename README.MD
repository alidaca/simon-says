# Simon Says
Simon says game built using Jquery. Play the game [here](http://alidaca.github.io/simon-says/)

## Functionality
- User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

- User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

- User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

- User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
